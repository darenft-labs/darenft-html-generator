# Bones

Bones is a tiny SCSS addon that includes *very* common style rules compacted into CSS classes and SCSS mixins, such as `text-left` alignment, `pb10` bottom padding and `flex` display classes and several other handy mixins.

It is a small cherry on top of [**pure.css**](https://purecss.io) and [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and contains only the most common style rules I tend to use. Combining Bones with those two starting points serves well as a beginning for pretty much any website, complete with utility CSS classes, grids and basic support for mobile out-of-the-box.
